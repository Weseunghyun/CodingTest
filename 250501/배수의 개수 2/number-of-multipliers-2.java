Explanation:
This code uses a `for` loop to iterate through the first 10 integers input by the user, and counts the number of even numbers using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result of the modulo operation is zero, then the current integer is even, and the count is incremented. The resulting count is then printed to the console using `System.out.println()`.

The code uses only primitive types and does not import any external libraries, making it a more efficient and lightweight solution. It also follows the constraints of the problem by only accepting inputs between 1 and 500, and outputting the number of even numbers. The self-test verifies that the program works correctly with the provided example input and output.
